# Basic-Portfolio Homework
This is the Basic-Portfolio homework due on September 5, 2018

## About me
The purpose of this main page is to help you get to know me.   I worked in technology related fields for many years, but never wrote code until this course.  I hope to successfully complete this bootcamp and go on to an exiting career in development.  

## Projects in my portfolio
The projects listed in my portfolio took a lot of sweat (maybe a tear or two...) to accomplish.  I hope to work on building more and more complex projects as I continue my journey through the bootcamp.  

## Get in touch with me
I would love to collaborate on projects to increase my knowledge of web development.   Last week I learned about this new world called bootstrap so I'm looking forward to learning more and more about that.  Feel free to reach out via linked in or via email at isaac.bayon@sbcglobal.com.
