            Hello!  Welcome to my bio page.  My name is Isaac Bayon, and I have a love of learning.  As a personal challenge, I push myself to learn something new every year.  In the past few years I’ve done the following to force me out of my comfort zone: 
            <ul>
                
                <li>Guitar lessons</li>
                <li>Swimming lessons</li>
                <li>Ice skating lessons</li>
                <li>Full stack developer bootcamp</li>
                
            </ul>
    </P>
    <P>During the day I work for a financial institution in Chicago.  The best way to describe 
        what I do is with an air traffic controller analogy.  I’m responsible for safely landing
         software code in the production environment by ensuring code deployments don’t crash 
         into each other as they reach their intended location.

    </P>
    <P>For most of my professional career I’ve worked in Technology Operations.  I’ve had an 
        opportunity to work with code developers and product owners to support their final product 
        once it’s gone live.  I’ve also had the opportunity to manage teams of people in which my 
        focus was to ensure their professional success and the success of the goals of the business
         teams we supported.

    </P>
    <p>
            For fun I like to read and hike –sometimes both at the same time &#9786;.  As a family 
            we visit one or more National parks a year.  It’s a good time to reflect on all the 
            natural wonders of our planet and to also take time to replenish the mind and soul.
    </p>
