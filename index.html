    <P>
        This paragraph is about me.  Although I hope to distract you by 
        writing about something that has nothing to do about me.  If I 
        tell you about my fascination with coconut La Croix, I hope you 
        can relate.  If you can't relate, it's most likely
        because you've never had it.  Once you do, you won't go back
        to the regular La Croix junk.  A coconut La Croix is like drinking
        a martini on the beach (minus the hard stuff).  So what are you waiting for?  
        Go get a Coconut!!!!
    
    </P>
    <P>This here is another paragraph with more juicy info about my La Croix drinking habbit!

    </P>
    <P>For fun I'm adding a third paragraph so that I write about more useless stuff
